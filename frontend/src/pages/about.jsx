                                Cove is the creation of a trio of young
                                university students who came together to make
                                something we felt was missing from the internet:
                                a cozy space for people who love writing, just
                                for the fun of it. Like many of you, we write in
                                notebooks, in messy docs, between classes or
                                late at night when ideas won't let us sleep.
                            </p>
                            <p className='text-black leading-relaxed'>
                                We believe that writing should be a joy, not a
                                burden. Whether you're crafting your first poem,
                                working on a novel, or simply journaling your
                                thoughts, every word matters. Our vision was to
                                create a digital sanctuary where writers could
                                focus on what they love most—the pure act of
                                creation—without the distractions of metrics,
                                algorithms, or the pressure to perform.

                                    somewhere you could write, explore ideas,
                                    and enjoy the process. While browsing
                                    writing tools and communities, we kept
                                    running into the same issue: everything felt
                                    a little too cold, too polished, too focused
                                    on productivity or publishing.
