# IMY320: UX Project

## 📝 Overview of the project

Build acohesive prototype of an exclusively online hobby store. The initial 3 submissions will be formatted to create individual components that will form your
final website. Submission 4 is a compulsory UX evaluation.

For each submission, the group will be provided with a list of functions to be completed and a problem statement (a quote from the owner) that needs to be resolved based on a particular
law of UX design covered in class. The group is required to conduct three (in total) short user experience research on an existing website (UEQ shortened questionnaire), take note of any criteria that scored relatively low/high, and use this to formulate a set of design guidelines. This will also help you establish common feature trends or existing practices used within the industry.

> **Research Methodology**: User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) shortened format applied across three major e-commerce platforms to establish industry benchmarks and identify optimization opportunities.

The general operations of the website should allow user/customer to log in to access the website, allow browsing the store, add things to a cart, checkout, and check their order history (most general operations for an e-commerce website). In addition to these general operations, your group needs to determine what other features might be needed and implement them accordingly.
